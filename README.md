# Arduino-Uno-W5100-BMP180-with-MCS
This is a open source code for Arduino project. If you have any questions, please leave your comments in here. I will response as soon as possibly.
Note:
1. BMP180 or BMP085 both are compatiable in this project. Here I use BMP180. You can alternatively use BMP085 for use. 
2. MCS has an account requirement. You need a account before uploading your. Here is its website: https://mcs.mediatek.com. The quick start guide is here: https://mcs.mediatek.com/resources/latest/tutorial.
3. If you encounter a matters on DHCP-there is a prompts-"Failed to configure Ethernet using DHCP", please re-connect your ethernet plugs on every ports on your wall, router or W5100. This may get worked. Then, upload your code again. There is a sample code-DhcpAddressPrinter. This is a DHCP test code for examination.
